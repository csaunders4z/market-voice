# News Collection Enhancement Plan
**Date**: July 1, 2025  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Fixes script generation quality issues

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Statement**

The Market Voices system has excellent technical infrastructure but poor script quality because **we collect insufficient news data to explain stock movements**. The current system:

- Only collects news for stocks moving >3%
- Provides shallow headline summaries instead of explanatory content
- Lacks stock-specific causal analysis
- Results in generic, template-based scripts instead of data-driven narratives

## ðŸš€ **Solution: Multi-Source News Intelligence System**

### **Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (Week 1)**

#### **1.1 Expand News Collection Coverage**
**Current**: Only stocks with >3% moves  
**New**: Collect news for ALL top 10 winners and losers

```python
# Enhanced company news collection
def get_comprehensive_stock_news(self, symbol: str, company_name: str, percent_change: float) -> Dict:
    """Get comprehensive news explaining stock movement"""
    
    # Collect from multiple timeframes
    news_sources = {
        'today': self.get_multi_source_news(symbol, hours_back=24),
        'recent': self.get_multi_source_news(symbol, hours_back=168),  # 7 days
        'earnings': self.get_earnings_related_news(symbol),
        'analyst': self.get_analyst_coverage(symbol),
        'sector': self.get_sector_news(symbol)
    }
    
    # Analyze and synthesize
    return self.synthesize_stock_story(symbol, news_sources, percent_change)
```

#### **1.2 Add Free News Sources**
**Problem**: Over-reliance on paid APIs  
**Solution**: Add comprehensive free sources

```python
# Free news sources to add
FREE_NEWS_SOURCES = {
    'yahoo_finance': f'https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/{symbol}/news',
    'marketwatch': f'https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/{symbol}',
    'seeking_alpha': f'https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/{symbol}/news',
    'benzinga': f'https://www.benzinga.com/quote/{symbol}',
    'fool': f'https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/{symbol}/',
    'finviz': f'https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t={symbol}',
    'investing_com': f'https://www.investing.com/search/?q={symbol}',
    'reuters': f'https://www.reuters.com/companies/{symbol}',
    'bloomberg': f'https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/{symbol}',
    'cnbc': f'https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/{symbol}'
}
```

#### **1.3 Web Scraping for Stock-Specific News**
```python
class StockNewsScaper:
    """Scrape free financial news sources for stock-specific content"""
    
    def scrape_yahoo_finance_news(self, symbol: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Scrape Yahoo Finance news for specific stock"""
        
    def scrape_seeking_alpha_articles(self, symbol: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Scrape Seeking Alpha for detailed analysis"""
        
    def scrape_marketwatch_stories(self, symbol: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Scrape MarketWatch for recent stories"""
```

### **Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (Week 2)**

#### **2.1 News Analysis Engine**
```python
class NewsIntelligenceEngine:
    """Analyze news to extract stock movement catalysts"""
    
    def identify_catalysts(self, symbol: str, news_articles: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
        """Identify specific catalysts driving stock movement"""
        return {
            'earnings_surprise': self.analyze_earnings_impact(news_articles),
            'analyst_actions': self.extract_analyst_changes(news_articles),
            'product_announcements': self.find_product_news(news_articles),
            'regulatory_news': self.identify_regulatory_impacts(news_articles),
            'partnership_deals': self.find_partnership_news(news_articles),
            'guidance_changes': self.extract_guidance_updates(news_articles),
            'sector_trends': self.analyze_sector_momentum(news_articles)
        }
    
    def generate_movement_explanation(self, symbol: str, catalysts: Dict, percent_change: float) -> str:
        """Generate detailed explanation of why stock moved"""
```

#### **2.2 Market Context Engine**
```python
class MarketContextAnalyzer:
    """Provide broader market context for stock movements"""
    
    def analyze_sector_rotation(self, symbol: str) -> Dict:
        """Analyze if move is part of broader sector rotation"""
        
    def identify_market_themes(self, all_movers: List[Dict]) -> List[str]:
        """Identify common themes across market movers"""
        # Examples: "AI momentum", "Rate cut anticipation", "Earnings season"
        
    def connect_macro_events(self, movement_date: str) -> Dict:
        """Connect stock moves to macro events (Fed meetings, economic data)"""
```

### **Phase 3: Content Generation Enhancement (Week 3)**

#### **3.1 Story Templates Based on Catalysts**
```python
CATALYST_TEMPLATES = {
    'earnings_beat': "{symbol} surged {percent_change}% following a {metric} earnings beat. The company reported {actual} vs {expected} expected, with {key_metric} driving the outperformance. {analyst_quote}",
    
    'analyst_upgrade': "{symbol} jumped {percent_change}% after {analyst_firm} upgraded the stock from {old_rating} to {new_rating}, citing {reasoning}. The new price target of ${target} represents {upside}% upside.",
    
    'product_launch': "{symbol} gained {percent_change}% on news of {product_announcement}. The {product_category} is expected to {impact_description} and could contribute ${revenue_estimate} in additional revenue.",
    
    'regulatory_approval': "{symbol} spiked {percent_change}% after {regulatory_body} approved {product/service}. This opens up a ${market_size} market opportunity for the company."
}
```

#### **3.2 Enhanced Script Generator Integration**
```python
def create_enhanced_script_prompt(self, market_data: Dict, detailed_news: Dict) -> str:
    """Create script prompt with comprehensive news integration"""
    
    # For each stock, include:
    # - Specific movement catalyst
    # - Supporting news sources
    # - Analyst opinions
    # - Market context
    # - Forward-looking statements
    
    for stock in winners:
        catalyst_analysis = detailed_news.get(symbol, {})
        prompt += f"""
        {symbol} Analysis (Host: {host}):
        Movement: {percent_change}% ({explain_magnitude})
        Primary Catalyst: {catalyst_analysis.get('primary_catalyst')}
        Supporting Evidence: {catalyst_analysis.get('evidence')}
        Market Context: {catalyst_analysis.get('market_context')}
        Analyst Perspective: {catalyst_analysis.get('analyst_view')}
        What to Watch: {catalyst_analysis.get('forward_looking')}
        Sources: {catalyst_analysis.get('sources')}
        """
```

### **Script Content Enhancement**
Instead of: *"Apple gained 2.8% today as tech stocks performed well."*

We'll have: *"Apple surged 2.8% following its stronger-than-expected iPhone 15 sales data released this morning. Wedbush analysts raised their price target from $200 to $220, citing robust demand in China and the upcoming AI integration features. The move comes as the broader tech sector rotates into hardware plays ahead of the holiday season, with Apple's ecosystem advantage positioning it well for the AI revolution. Trading volume was 2.3x normal, suggesting institutional accumulation. Watch for management commentary on AI monetization during next week's earnings call."*

**Next Steps**: 
1. Approve this enhancement plan
2. Begin implementation of free news source scraping
3. Test enhanced news collection with current script generator
4. Measure improvement in script quality scores
