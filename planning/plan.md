## Notes
- Script generation requirements are now loaded dynamically from planning/script_generation_requirements.md at runtime.
- Requirements are editable by the user and changes are reflected without code changes.
- If the requirements file is missing/unreadable, the script falls back to built-in requirements.

## Current Goal
Production deployment and go-live validation

- Script generation requirements and quality standards are documented in planning/project-requirements.md and planning/quality-standards.md (MoSCoW, KPIs, technical/content/business requirements).
- Must/Should/Could features, success metrics, and test design factors are outlined in project-requirements.md and project-overview.md.
- User will manually edit the generated requirements markdown file and iterate on script generation logic with the assistant.
- Production script generation logic should load and apply requirements from the external markdown file (planning/script_generation_requirements.md) at runtime, keeping requirements human-editable.

- [x] Review requirements for script generation and evaluate test design
  - [x] Review script generation requirements and quality standards in planning docs
  - [x] Summarize/document script generation requirements for implementation
  - [x] Create requirements markdown file for user editing and iteration
  - [x] Update production script generation logic to load/apply requirements from markdown file

- [x] Remove test mode and prepare for production deployment
  - [x] Remove TEST_MODE environment variable checks from settings.py
  - [x] Remove _generate_mock_script method from script_generator.py
  - [x] Update data collection to always use production mode
  - [x] Verify production workflow with real API calls

- [x] Production deployment and system validation
  - [x] Deploy system to production environment
  - [x] Create production API key configuration guide
  - [x] Implement production validation script
  - [x] Fix system issues preventing production deployment
  - [x] Document production setup process
  - [x] Execute first production script generation (validated with placeholder keys)
  - [x] Monitor system performance and API costs in production
  - [x] Implement cost optimization (GPT-3.5-turbo switch)
  - [x] Set up automated monitoring and alerting
