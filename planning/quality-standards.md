# Success Metrics and Quality Definitions

## Overview
This document defines "good enough" for Market Voices output at various stages of the workflow, ensuring consistent quality standards across all production phases.

## Stock Information Quality Standards

### Causal Explanation Requirements
- **Must contain** as much causal explanation as possible for stock movement
- **OK to be factually incorrect** if reporting what other sources identified as the cause
- **Never draw our own conclusions** - only report what credible sources have stated
- **Include technical signals** when relevant, but avoid obvious conclusions
- **Avoid stating the obvious** (e.g., "reduced market cap is due to reduced stock price")

### Data Completeness Requirements
- **Must include**: current price, % change, $ change, volume vs average
- **At least one news source** from the current trading day
- **Technical indicators** when extreme (RSI > 70 or < 30, MACD crossover)
- **For moves > 5%**: at least two independent news sources should confirm the reason

### Time Sensitivity Standards
- **News must be from**:
  - Current trading day for normal market hours moves
  - After previous day's close for pre-market moves
  - No older than 24 hours unless explicitly relevant
- **Technical data** must be from latest market close

### Technical Indicator Thresholds
- **RSI**: Only mention if > 70 or < 30
- **MACD**: Only mention if crossing signal line
- **Volume**: Only mention if > 2x average daily volume
- **Moving Averages**: Only mention crosses of 50-day or 200-day

## Script Quality Standards

### Authenticity Requirements

### Transition Standards
- **Logical connections** between stocks when possible (same sector, opposing moves)
- **Maximum 2 seconds** of silence between segments
- **Natural handoffs** between hosts (no abrupt switches)

### Context Requirements

  - Multiple stocks in same sector are moving
  - Stock move is contrary to sector trend
  - Sector-wide news is driving movement

### Conflicting News Handling
