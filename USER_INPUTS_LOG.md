# User Inputs Log - Production Run Session

**Date:** July 15, 2025  
**Session:** Production validation and immediate fixes  

## User Feedback on Production Issues

### Initial Task
- **Request**: "Execute a full production run of our application and see what breaks"
- **Scope**: Full production validation including planning and implementation with real API keys

### Production Run Results Feedback
- **User Observation**: "didn't the run throw a bunch of errors though?"
- **Context**: User correctly identified that while validation tests passed, the actual production workflow (120s main.py run) threw extensive errors
- **Accuracy**: User was right - 100+ Finnhub 422 errors, NewsAPI 401 errors, Biztoc rate limits, and script quality validation failure

## User Priorities for Immediate Fixes

### Focus Direction
- **User Request**: "please focus on immediate fixes"
- **Priority**: Address blocking production issues rather than comprehensive analysis

### API Rate Limiting Strategy
- **User Input**: "I am open to your suggestions on API rate limiting strategies"
- **Implication**: User wants specific recommendations for handling the 100+ Finnhub 422 errors and rate limiting issues
- **Context**: Current system fails under production load (516 symbols) but works for smaller validation tests (50 symbols)

### Script Phrase Repetition
- **User Input**: "It is critical for the script to have no repeated phrases. I am open to your suggestions on how to identify if this has occurred and mitigate it."
- **Priority**: **CRITICAL** - This is a blocking issue for production
- **Current Issue**: "No 4-word phrase should appear more than twice" validation failed during production workflow
- **Requirements**: 
  - Must detect phrase repetition accurately
  - Must prevent/mitigate repetition in generated scripts
  - User considers this essential for script quality

## Session Conclusion Instructions
- **User Request**: "please just log those inputs from me, update plan.md accordingly, and push up all changes. then we can conclude this session for tonight."
- **Actions Required**:
  1. Log user inputs (this document)
  2. Update plan.md with user feedback
  3. Push all changes to repository
  4. Conclude session

## Key Takeaways
1. **Validation vs Production Gap**: Validation tests passing doesn't mean production workflow works
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Major blocker requiring immediate attention with user open to suggestions
3. **Script Quality**: Phrase repetition is critical and must be fixed
4. **Focus**: Immediate fixes over comprehensive analysis
5. **Honesty**: User appreciated correction of overly optimistic assessment
