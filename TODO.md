# SECONDARY TODO - AFTER NEWS ENHANCEMENT

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Always collect price change data for ALL S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 stocks before generating a script. Do not proceed with script generation unless full index coverage is achieved.
- [ ] **Automate fallback symbol list updates:** Use the symbol updater script to fetch up-to-date S&P 500 (from DataHub) and NASDAQ-100 (from Wikipedia) symbols. The static fallback list must be kept current.
- [ ] **Robust fallback update logic:** Improve the symbol updater's fallback list replacement logic to ensure it never leaves the codebase in a broken state (e.g., always produce valid Python syntax in `fmp_stock_data.py`).
- [ ] **Default to comprehensive collector:** Use the comprehensive data collector as the default for all production workflows to guarantee full index coverage.
- [ ] **Test after symbol updates:** After each symbol update, review and test the fallback list and data collection to ensure the codebase is not broken and coverage is complete.

- [x] Remove reliance on FMP premium endpoints (earnings calendars, insider trades, analyst stock recommendations)
- [x] Focus news collection on same-day (today's) articles for each winner and loser stock
- [x] Attach only today's news articles to each stock for script generation and analysis
- [x] Update all collectors and scrapers to filter for today-only news
- [x] Test and verify today-only news filtering in all modules
- [x] Make news-driven workflow the default for catalyst detection

## NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Further tune the definition of "today" (e.g., handle time zones, allow for late-night/overnight articles)
- [ ] Enhance catalyst detection from news articles (e.g., keyword/phrase scan for earnings, upgrades, M&A, etc.)
- [ ] Optionally, add more news sources or improve fallback logic for low-news days

---

**Note:**
- The system now exclusively uses news articles published today for each winner and loser stock.
- All non-news catalyst sources (FMP premium endpoints) have been removed.
- The workflow is now fully news-driven and ready for further enhancement.

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Always collect price change data for ALL S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 stocks before generating a script. Do not proceed with script generation unless full index coverage is achieved.
- [ ] **Automate fallback symbol list updates:** Use the symbol updater script to fetch up-to-date S&P 500 (from DataHub) and NASDAQ-100 (from Wikipedia) symbols. The static fallback list must be kept current.
- [ ] **Robust fallback update logic:** Improve the symbol updater's fallback list replacement logic to ensure it never leaves the codebase in a broken state (e.g., always produce valid Python syntax in `fmp_stock_data.py`).
- [ ] **Default to comprehensive collector:** Use the comprehensive data collector as the default for all production workflows to guarantee full index coverage.
- [ ] **Test after symbol updates:** After each symbol update, review and test the fallback list and data collection to ensure the codebase is not broken and coverage is complete.

- [x] Remove reliance on FMP premium endpoints (earnings calendars, insider trades, analyst stock recommendations)
- [x] Focus news collection on same-day (today's) articles for each winner and loser stock
- [x] Attach only today's news articles to each stock for script generation and analysis
- [x] Update all collectors and scrapers to filter for today-only news
- [x] Test and verify today-only news filtering in all modules
- [x] Make news-driven workflow the default for catalyst detection

## NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Further tune the definition of "today" (e.g., handle time zones, allow for late-night/overnight articles)
- [ ] Enhance catalyst detection from news articles (e.g., keyword/phrase scan for earnings, upgrades, M&A, etc.)
- [ ] Optionally, add more news sources or improve fallback logic for low-news days

---

**Note:**
- The system now exclusively uses news articles published today for each winner and loser stock.
- All non-news catalyst sources (FMP premium endpoints) have been removed.
- The workflow is now fully news-driven and ready for further enhancement.

# SECONDARY TODO - AFTER NEWS ENHANCEMENT

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Always collect price change data for ALL S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 stocks before generating a script. Do not proceed with script generation unless full index coverage is achieved.
- [ ] **Automate fallback symbol list updates:** Use the symbol updater script to fetch up-to-date S&P 500 (from DataHub) and NASDAQ-100 (from Wikipedia) symbols. The static fallback list must be kept current.
- [ ] **Robust fallback update logic:** Improve the symbol updater's fallback list replacement logic to ensure it never leaves the codebase in a broken state (e.g., always produce valid Python syntax in `fmp_stock_data.py`).
- [ ] **Default to comprehensive collector:** Use the comprehensive data collector as the default for all production workflows to guarantee full index coverage.
- [ ] **Test after symbol updates:** After each symbol update, review and test the fallback list and data collection to ensure the codebase is not broken and coverage is complete.

- [x] Remove reliance on FMP premium endpoints (earnings calendars, insider trades, analyst stock recommendations)
- [x] Focus news collection on same-day (today's) articles for each winner and loser stock
- [x] Attach only today's news articles to each stock for script generation and analysis
- [x] Update all collectors and scrapers to filter for today-only news
- [x] Test and verify today-only news filtering in all modules
- [x] Make news-driven workflow the default for catalyst detection

## NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Further tune the definition of "today" (e.g., handle time zones, allow for late-night/overnight articles)
- [ ] Enhance catalyst detection from news articles (e.g., keyword/phrase scan for earnings, upgrades, M&A, etc.)
- [ ] Optionally, add more news sources or improve fallback logic for low-news days

---

**Note:**
- The system now exclusively uses news articles published today for each winner and loser stock.
- All non-news catalyst sources (FMP premium endpoints) have been removed.
- The workflow is now fully news-driven and ready for further enhancement.

# SECONDARY TODO - AFTER NEWS ENHANCEMENT

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Always collect price change data for ALL S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 stocks before generating a script. Do not proceed with script generation unless full index coverage is achieved.
- [ ] **Automate fallback symbol list updates:** Use the symbol updater script to fetch up-to-date S&P 500 (from DataHub) and NASDAQ-100 (from Wikipedia) symbols. The static fallback list must be kept current.
- [ ] **Robust fallback update logic:** Improve the symbol updater's fallback list replacement logic to ensure it never leaves the codebase in a broken state (e.g., always produce valid Python syntax in `fmp_stock_data.py`).
- [ ] **Default to comprehensive collector:** Use the comprehensive data collector as the default for all production workflows to guarantee full index coverage.
- [ ] **Test after symbol updates:** After each symbol update, review and test the fallback list and data collection to ensure the codebase is not broken and coverage is complete.

- [x] Remove reliance on FMP premium endpoints (earnings calendars, insider trades, analyst stock recommendations)
- [x] Focus news collection on same-day (today's) articles for each winner and loser stock
- [x] Attach only today's news articles to each stock for script generation and analysis
- [x] Update all collectors and scrapers to filter for today-only news
- [x] Test and verify today-only news filtering in all modules
- [x] Make news-driven workflow the default for catalyst detection

## NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Further tune the definition of "today" (e.g., handle time zones, allow for late-night/overnight articles)
- [ ] Enhance catalyst detection from news articles (e.g., keyword/phrase scan for earnings, upgrades, M&A, etc.)
- [ ] Optionally, add more news sources or improve fallback logic for low-news days

---

**Note:**
- The system now exclusively uses news articles published today for each winner and loser stock.
- All non-news catalyst sources (FMP premium endpoints) have been removed.
- The workflow is now fully news-driven and ready for further enhancement.

# SECONDARY TODO - AFTER NEWS ENHANCEMENT

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Always collect price change data for ALL S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 stocks before generating a script. Do not proceed with script generation unless full index coverage is achieved.
- [ ] **Automate fallback symbol list updates:** Use the symbol updater script to fetch up-to-date S&P 500 (from DataHub) and NASDAQ-100 (from Wikipedia) symbols. The static fallback list must be kept current.
- [ ] **Robust fallback update logic:** Improve the symbol updater's fallback list replacement logic to ensure it never leaves the codebase in a broken state (e.g., always produce valid Python syntax in `fmp_stock_data.py`).
- [ ] **Default to comprehensive collector:** Use the comprehensive data collector as the default for all production workflows to guarantee full index coverage.
- [ ] **Test after symbol updates:** After each symbol update, review and test the fallback list and data collection to ensure the codebase is not broken and coverage is complete.

- [x] Remove reliance on FMP premium endpoints (earnings calendars, insider trades, analyst stock recommendations)
- [x] Focus news collection on same-day (today's) articles for each winner and loser stock
- [x] Attach only today's news articles to each stock for script generation and analysis
- [x] Update all collectors and scrapers to filter for today-only news
- [x] Test and verify today-only news filtering in all modules
- [x] Make news-driven workflow the default for catalyst detection

## NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Further tune the definition of "today" (e.g., handle time zones, allow for late-night/overnight articles)
- [ ] Enhance catalyst detection from news articles (e.g., keyword/phrase scan for earnings, upgrades, M&A, etc.)
- [ ] Optionally, add more news sources or improve fallback logic for low-news days

---

**Note:**
- The system now exclusively uses news articles published today for each winner and loser stock.
- All non-news catalyst sources (FMP premium endpoints) have been removed.
- The workflow is now fully news-driven and ready for further enhancement.

- [x] Focus news collection on same-day (today's) articles for each winner and loser stock
- [x] Attach only today's news articles to each stock for script generation and analysis
- [x] Update all collectors and scrapers to filter for today-only news
- [x] Test and verify today-only news filtering in all modules
- [x] Make news-driven workflow the default for catalyst detection

## NEXT STEPS

- [ ] Further tune the definition of "today" (e.g., handle time zones, allow for late-night/overnight articles)
- [ ] Enhance catalyst detection from news articles (e.g., keyword/phrase scan for earnings, upgrades, M&A, etc.)
- [ ] Optionally, add more news sources or improve fallback logic for low-news days

---

**Note:**
- The system now exclusively uses news articles published today for each winner and loser stock.
- All non-news catalyst sources (FMP premium endpoints) have been removed.
- The workflow is now fully news-driven and ready for further enhancement.

# SECONDARY TODO - AFTER NEWS ENHANCEMENT

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Always collect price change data for ALL S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 stocks before generating a script. Do not proceed with script generation unless full index coverage is achieved.
- [ ] **Automate fallback symbol list updates:** Use the symbol updater script to fetch up-to-date S&P 500 (from DataHub) and NASDAQ-100 (from Wikipedia) symbols. The static fallback list must be kept current.
- [ ] **Robust fallback update logic:** Improve the symbol updater's fallback list replacement logic to ensure it never leaves the codebase in a broken state (e.g., always produce valid Python syntax in `fmp_stock_data.py`).
- [ ] **Default to comprehensive collector:** Use the comprehensive data collector as the default for all production workflows to guarantee full index coverage.
- [ ] **Test after symbol updates:** After each symbol update, review and test the fallback list and data collection to ensure the codebase is not broken and coverage is complete.
