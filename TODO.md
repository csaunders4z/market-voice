# TODO

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Always collect price change data for ALL S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 stocks before generating a script. Do not proceed with script generation unless full index coverage is achieved.
- [ ] **Automate fallback symbol list updates:** Use the symbol updater script to fetch up-to-date S&P 500 (from DataHub) and NASDAQ-100 (from Wikipedia) symbols. The static fallback list must be kept current.
- [ ] **Robust fallback update logic:** Improve the symbol updater's fallback list replacement logic to ensure it never leaves the codebase in a broken state (e.g., always produce valid Python syntax in `fmp_stock_data.py`).
- [ ] **Default to comprehensive collector:** Use the comprehensive data collector as the default for all production workflows to guarantee full index coverage.
- [ ] **Test after symbol updates:** After each symbol update, review and test the fallback list and data collection to ensure the codebase is not broken and coverage is complete.
