## 🚀 **CRITICAL: News Collection Enhancement (BLOCKS PRODUCTION)**

### 0. **URGENT: Fix Script Quality Through Enhanced News Collection**
**Priority**: CRITICAL - BLOCKING PRODUCTION | **Estimated Time**: 3 weeks

**Problem Identified**: System has excellent infrastructure but poor script quality (50% score) due to insufficient news data to explain stock movements.

#### Week 1: Foundation (July 1-7) - IMMEDIATE START
- [ ] **Day 1-2**: Implement free news source scraping (Yahoo Finance, Seeking Alpha, MarketWatch, Benzinga, Reuters, Bloomberg, CNBC)
- [ ] **Day 3-4**: Expand news collection to ALL top 10 winners and losers (currently only >3% moves)
- [ ] **Day 5**: Create comprehensive stock news collection system
- [ ] **Day 6-7**: Integrate enhanced news data with script generator

#### Week 2: Intelligence Layer (July 8-14)
- [ ] **Day 1-3**: Build news analysis engine to identify movement catalysts
- [ ] **Day 4-5**: Implement catalyst identification (earnings, analyst actions, product news, regulatory, partnerships)
- [ ] **Day 6-7**: Add market context analyzer (sector rotation, market themes, macro events)

#### Week 3: Content Generation (July 15-21)
- [ ] **Day 1-3**: Create story templates based on specific catalysts
- [ ] **Day 4-5**: Enhance script generation with detailed news integration
- [ ] **Day 6-7**: Full system testing and quality validation

#### New Files to Create:
```
src/data_collection/
├── stock_news_scraper.py        # Free news source scraping
├── news_intelligence.py         # Catalyst analysis engine
├── market_context_analyzer.py   # Broader market themes
└── story_synthesizer.py         # Generate explanatory narratives

src/script_generation/
├── catalyst_templates.py        # Story templates by catalyst type
└── enhanced_prompt_builder.py   # Build detailed prompts with news
```

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] **Script Quality Score**: 50% → 85%+ (CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION)
- [ ] **Content Length**: 655 words → 1440+ words
- [ ] **News Coverage**: 100% of top movers have explanatory news content
- [ ] **Catalyst Identification**: 90% of stock moves have identified catalysts
- [ ] **Content Quality**: Data-driven narratives instead of generic templates

#### Expected Impact:
Transform script content from: *"Apple gained 2.8% today as tech stocks performed well."*

To: *"Apple surged 2.8% following stronger-than-expected iPhone 15 sales data released this morning. Wedbush analysts raised their price target from $200 to $220, citing robust demand in China and upcoming AI integration features. The move comes as broader tech sector rotates into hardware plays ahead of holiday season, with Apple's ecosystem advantage positioning it well for AI revolution. Trading volume was 2.3x normal, suggesting institutional accumulation. Watch for management commentary on AI monetization during next week's earnings call."*

# SECONDARY TODO - AFTER NEWS ENHANCEMENT

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Always collect price change data for ALL S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 stocks before generating a script. Do not proceed with script generation unless full index coverage is achieved.
- [ ] **Automate fallback symbol list updates:** Use the symbol updater script to fetch up-to-date S&P 500 (from DataHub) and NASDAQ-100 (from Wikipedia) symbols. The static fallback list must be kept current.
- [ ] **Robust fallback update logic:** Improve the symbol updater's fallback list replacement logic to ensure it never leaves the codebase in a broken state (e.g., always produce valid Python syntax in `fmp_stock_data.py`).
- [ ] **Default to comprehensive collector:** Use the comprehensive data collector as the default for all production workflows to guarantee full index coverage.
- [ ] **Test after symbol updates:** After each symbol update, review and test the fallback list and data collection to ensure the codebase is not broken and coverage is complete.
