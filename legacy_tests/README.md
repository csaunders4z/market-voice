# Legacy/Archived Test Files

This folder contains test files that have been archived as part of the test suite audit. These tests were flagged for one or more of the following reasons:
- Duplicative with core/integration tests
- Unclear or legacy purpose
- Debug or quick tests not needed in the main suite
- Superseded by more robust or up-to-date tests

Tests here are preserved for reference and can be reviewed, reintegrated, or deleted in the future as needed.

**Criteria for archiving:**
- Not uniquely covering a critical feature
- Not referenced in current documentation or workflows
- Not actively maintained or run in CI

If you need to restore a test, simply move it back to the main test directory.
