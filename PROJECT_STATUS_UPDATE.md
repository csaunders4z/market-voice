## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention**

### üö® **Script Generation Quality - NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX**
**Status**: **50% quality score** (Target: 80%+)

**Issues Identified**:
- **Content Length**: 655 words generated vs. required 1440+ words
- **Repetitive Content**: 9 phrases repeated more than 2 times
- **Poor Data Integration**: Rich market data collected but not utilized in scripts
- **Template-based Content**: Scripts appear generic rather than data-driven
- **Missing Transitions**: 0.0 transitions per segment (poor flow)

**Root Cause**: Script generation logic not properly integrating collected market data and news content.

**Impact**: **BLOCKS PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT** - Content quality below professional standards.
